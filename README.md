# Guessing_Game
The Guessing Game was a project that was given to me by my java instructor. The instructor gave us a week to come up with the code from scratch. I am proud of this code because I am very new to programming and I was able to get the project done with in the time that was given.  The project itself will turn on and let the user know that they are playing a number game, and that the program will generate a random number between 1 and 100. Then the program will prompt the user to choose a number between the specified number ranges.  Once the user has input their answer, the program will check the user input with the rest of the code. The first thing the program will check is to see if the number is in the range given to the user.  If the input is within specified ranges then it will move on. Once the program knows that the input is within the ranges given, it will move to the next if statement.  The next part of the program checks to see if the input is higher or lower that the randomly generated number. If the input is higher that the generated number, the program will tell the user that the number they have guessed is too high and will prompt them to guess again.  If the guess is lower than the generated number it will tell the user that their guess is too low and will prompt them to guess again. If the guess is right, the program will let the user know that they have guessed the correct number.
